    <p>Each team will work on a set of eight programming problems during the 3-hour time period. The team that solves the most amount of problems will win the contest, and time needed to solve will be a tiebreaker.</p>
    <p>The grading system for the competition will be <a href="https://open.kattis.com">Kattis</a>. Feel free to practice and get used to the platform. Some sample problems:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>You can use any language supported by the grading system (C, C++, Python2, Python3, Java, and more). Please bring your own computer (one per team) and be sure to set up what you need for programming.</p>
